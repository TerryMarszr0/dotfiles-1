My Dotfiles
===========

Overview
--------
* Window Manager - i3
* Editor         - Vim (vundle handles my plugins)
* Shell          - Zsh (Antigen is awesome)
* Terminal       - Terminology
* File Manager   - Ranger

I use pretty much everything out of the box but I've made some customizations to enhance my workflow
which I'll explain in a bit ;)
