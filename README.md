My Dotfiles
===========

Overview
--------
* Window Manager - [i3wm](http://i3wm.org/)
* Editor         - Vim ([Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) handles my vim plugins)
* Shell          - Zsh ([Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) is awesome)
* Terminal       - [Terminator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnome_Terminator)

I use pretty much everything out of the box but I've made some customizations to enhance my workflow
which I'll explain in a bit ;)

i3bar
-----
Nothing fancy and no hassle using conky here. Just load [fontawesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and you're good to go.
